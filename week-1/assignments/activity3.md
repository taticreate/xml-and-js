When you drop the xml files into google sheets it says:
"Sorry, that file type isn't supported for import.
Supported types are: csv, txt, tsv, tab, htm, html, xls, xlsx, xlsm, xlt, xltm, xltx, ods"
So it is not compatable with xml.

I think if I had excel on my computer and dropped the xml files in, it would take in the data is some way, but likely make it distorted.
